## Plan
Our initial plan is to build the basic functionality of our chatting application (_login with username_, _chatting as one open group_, _etc._). However, given enough time, we plan to implement group-chatting through commands

[ ] - `login <username> <group_id>`
[ ] - `group <group_id>` (_assumes user is already authenticated_)

Given even more time, we might plan to implement **Authorization** of our groups, firstly through simple commands any _group-user_ can apply, and later might implement _admin-roles_ for specific users.
