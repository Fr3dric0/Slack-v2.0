Slack v2.0 is a Command Line Interface (CLI) chatting application, with simple
authentication.

To get into the action, you the user only has to 'login' with a valid username 
(large or small letters and numbers)

if you don't understand how this works send a message to Fredrik Lindhagen and tell him to kill himself
